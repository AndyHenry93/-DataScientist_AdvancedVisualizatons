# College Degree Gender Gap
The purpuse of this project is to show the rate of change within college degrees of Males and Females. In this project I wanted to portry my visualzation skills by making the graphs easily readable and understandable, I also wanted to make them accessible to all so the only colors used in this project are from the Tableau RGB color blind  Palette.
